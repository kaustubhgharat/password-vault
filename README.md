## Features

- **Secure Authentication:** User registration and login system powered by `next-auth`.
- **Password Generator:** Create strong, customizable passwords.
- **Secure Vault:** Save, view, edit, and delete your login credentials.
- **Client-Side Encryption:** Your data is encrypted in your browser using your master password before it's sent to the server. The server only stores encrypted blobs.

## Note on Cryptography

For client-side encryption, this project uses **CryptoJS** with the **AES-256** standard.  
The encryption key is derived from the user's master password and a unique salt using **PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations**, providing strong resistance against brute-force attacks.
